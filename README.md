## üéÆ Overview

Welcome to the Card Game War project! This project provides a secure, cross-platform implementation of the classic card game "War" with a graphical interface and encrypted results storage.


**How it works:**
- Key files (`war.py`, etc.) are obfuscated and require the `pyarmor_runtime_007668` runtime folder to run.
- The runtime is included in the project and loaded automatically.
- This helps protect your code and intellectual property.

**How to use:**
- Run scripts as usual (e.g., `python war.py`).
- Do not delete or move the `pyarmor_runtime_007668` folder.


| File                | Purpose                                                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `war.py`            | Main GUI for playing War. Handles game logic, encryption, user input. Obfuscated with Pyarmor.|
| `generate_key.py`   | Generates a secure Fernet key for encrypting results.                   |
| `decrypt_results.py`| Decrypts and reads the encrypted results file.                          |
| `win-results.json`  | Stores encrypted game results.                                          |
| `win-results.key`   | Stores the Fernet encryption key.                                       |

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Encryption Key
Run the key generator:
```bash
python generate_key.py
```


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Play the Game
Start the GUI:
```bash
python war.py --gui
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Play the Console Version
To play the classic text-based version in your terminal:
```bash
python war.py
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ View Results
Decrypt and view results:
```bash
python decrypt_results.py
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Windows Quick Start
Double-click `run.bat` to:
- Generate the key (if missing)
- Launch the game

## üèÅ Cross-Platform Support
All `.py` files use `os` and `sys` for path handling and are compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux. No platform-specific code is used.

## üõ†Ô∏è Creating `run.bat`
```bat
@echo off
REM Generate key if missing
if not exist win-results.key (
    python generate_key.py
)
REM Start the game
python war.py
```

## üìù Notes
- Make sure `win-results.key` and `win-results.json` are in the same directory as the scripts.
- For Linux/macOS, use the same commands in your terminal.
